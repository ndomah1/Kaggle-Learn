# Kaggle Learn
This repo contains all the scripts I worked on from [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn).

## Phase 1: Foundation in Programming & Data Handling
### [Intro to Programming]() - If you're completely new to coding.
1. [Arithmetic and Variables]() - Make calculations, and define and modify variables.
2. [Functions]() - Organize your code and avoid redundancy.
3. [Data Types]() - Explore integers, floats, booleans, and strings.
4. [Conditions and Conditional Statements]() - Modify how functions run, depending on the input. 
5. [Intro to Lists]() - Organize your data so you can work with it efficiently.

### [Python]() - Essential for data science and machine learning.
1. [Hello, Python]() - A quick introduction to Python syntax, variable assignment, and numbers.
2. [Functions and Getting Help]() - Calling functions and defining our own, and using Python's builtin documentation.
3. [Booleans and Conditionals]() - Using booleans for branching logic.
4. [Lists]() - Lists and the things you can do with them. Includes indexing, slicing and mutating.
5. [Loops and List Comprehensions]() - For and while loops, and a much-loved Python feature: list comprehensions.
6. [Strings and Dictionaries]() - Working with strings and dictionaries, two fundamental Python data types.
7. [Working with External Libraries]() - Improts, operator overloading, and survival tips for venturing into the world of external libraries.

### [Pandas]() - For data manipulation and analysis.
1. [Creating, Reading and Writing]() - You can't work with data if you can't read it. Get started here.
2. [Indexing, Selecting & Assigning]() - Pro data scientists do this dozens of times a day. You can, too!
3. [Summary Functions and Maps]() - Extract insights from your data.
4. [Grouping and Sorting]() - Scale up your level of insight. The more complex the dataset, the more this matters.
5. [Data Types and Missing Values]() - Deal with the most common progress-blocking problems.
6. [Renaming and Combining]() - Data comes in from many sources. Help it all make sense together.

### [Intro to SQL]() - To work with databases.
1. [Getting Started with SQL and BigQuery]() - Learn the workflow for handling big datasets with BigQuery and SQL.
2. [Select, From & Where]() - The foundational components for all SQL queries
3. [Group By, Having & Count]() - Get more interesting insights directly from your SQL queries.
4. [Order By]() - Order your results to focus on the most important data for your use case.
5. [As & With]() - Organize your query for better readability. This becomes especially important for complex queries.
6. [Joining Data]() - Combine data sources. Critical for almost all real-world data problems.
